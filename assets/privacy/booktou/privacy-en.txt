Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Booktou app (the "App") and certain third-party services used by the App collect, use, and disclose information.

1. Summary

Booktou is a local-first app: user content (books, reading lists, notes, etc.) is stored on the user’s device and is not collected by the App for analytics or marketing purposes. However, the App uses third-party services (for ads and optional diagnostics) that may collect limited device and usage information independently. See the Advertising and Third-Party Services sections below.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect or transmit to our servers personal information such as name or email address as part of its core functionality.

If the user chooses, they may enter a profile name, profile picture, or biography within the App. This information is stored locally on the device only, is not shared with the developer, and is not used for marketing or analytics purposes.

3. App Data (Local Storage)

All books, reading lists, notes, and related data are stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit these items to our servers. The App provides a "Delete All Data" feature which will permanently remove the app's local data from your device. Alternatively, uninstalling the App will remove its local data from your device. Manual exports or backups you create are not affected by these actions and remain your responsibility.

Important note about updates and data loss: while Booktou stores user data locally, updates to the App, operating system changes, device malfunctions, or application bugs can (in rare cases) cause loss or corruption of local data. We strongly recommend that you periodically export or back up any important data you wish to keep. Booktou and its developers are not responsible for data lost due to updates, uninstallation, device failure, or third-party software.

4. Third-Party Services and SDKs

The App may integrate third-party libraries and SDKs (for example, for advertising). These providers may collect information independently of the App, such as device identifiers and usage statistics. We do not control third-party collection practices; please review their privacy policies (links below).

5. Advertising

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob and its partners may automatically collect device and usage information (for example: advertising identifiers, device model, OS version, and ad interaction data) to serve and measure ads. We do not use your personal or in-app content (for example: books, notes, or other user-created content) for advertising, profiling, or marketing purposes.

6. Cookies and Local Storage

The App does not use browser cookies. Some third-party SDKs may use local storage mechanisms or similar identifiers on the device to operate. Those mechanisms are managed by the third parties.

7. Premium Subscription

Booktou offers a Premium Subscription via in-app purchases on Google Play. Subscriptions are billed on a monthly basis and automatically renew unless cancelled by the user. Purchasing the Premium Subscription removes advertisements within the App and may provide additional premium features or functionality.

All subscription payments are processed by Google Play. Payment details are handled by Google and are not shared with Booktou. For refunds, subscription management, or cancellation, please use Google Play > Subscriptions or visit: https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions

8. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe their child under 13 has provided personal information may contact us at rapheldorsoftware@gmail.com
 to request deletion.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will update the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be highlighted or communicated in-app where feasible.
