Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Word Balloon Pop app (the "App") and certain third-party services used by the App collect, use, and disclose information.

1. Summary

Word Balloon Pop is a local-first app: user content (game progress, scores, achievements, settings, etc.) is stored on the user's device and is not collected by the App for analytics or marketing purposes. However, the App uses third-party services (for ads and optional diagnostics) that may collect limited device and usage information independently. See the Advertising and Third-Party Services sections below.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect or transmit to our servers personal information such as name or email address as part of its core functionality.

3. App Data (Local Storage)

All game progress, scores, achievements, settings, and related data are stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit these items to our servers. The App provides a "Delete All Data" feature which will permanently remove the app's local data from your device. Alternatively, uninstalling the App will remove its local data from your device. Manual exports or backups you create are not affected by these actions and remain your responsibility.

Important note about updates and data loss: while Word Balloon Pop stores user data locally, updates to the App, operating system changes, device malfunctions, or application bugs can (in rare cases) cause loss or corruption of local data. We strongly recommend that you periodically back up any important data you wish to keep. Word Balloon Pop and its developers are not responsible for data lost due to updates, uninstallation, device failure, or third-party software.

4. Third-Party Services and SDKs

The App may integrate third-party libraries and SDKs (for example, for advertising). These providers may collect information independently of the App, such as device identifiers and usage statistics. We do not control third-party collection practices; please review their privacy policies (links below).

5. Advertising

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob and its partners may automatically collect device and usage information (for example: advertising identifiers, device model, OS version, and ad interaction data) to serve and measure ads. We do not use your personal or in-app content (for example: game progress, scores, or other user-created content) for advertising, profiling, or marketing purposes.

6. Cookies and Local Storage

The App does not use browser cookies. Some third-party SDKs may use local storage mechanisms or similar identifiers on the device to operate. Those mechanisms are managed by the third parties.

7. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe their child under 13 has provided personal information may contact us at rapheldorsoftware@gmail.com to request deletion.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will update the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be highlighted or communicated in-app where feasible.
