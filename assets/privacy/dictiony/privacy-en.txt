5. Premium Subscription

Dictiony offers a Premium Subscription via in-app purchases on Google Play. Subscriptions are billed on a monthly basis and automatically renew unless cancelled by the user. Purchasing the Premium Subscription removes advertisements within the App and may provide additional premium features or functionality.

User-created data (practice sessions, progress, etc.) is not used for advertising, analytics, or marketing.

7. Data Deletion

Users can delete all data at any time using the in-app reset option.
Uninstalling the App will permanently remove all data from the device.
Backups created by the user are outside the App's control and must be deleted manually.

8. Security

All data remains on the device.
No internet transfer occurs.
100% security cannot be guaranteed; users are responsible for their device security.

9. Third-Party Libraries

Dictiony itself does not collect or share data.
However, the App may use third-party open-source libraries, and their behavior cannot be fully controlled. Therefore, 100% guarantees cannot be provided.

10. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe their child under 13 has provided personal information may contact us at rapheldorsoftware@gmail.com to request deletion.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will update the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be highlighted or communicated in-app where feasible.
